# Terraform Enterprise FDO - Mounted disk on Google Cloud Platform

This is a repository to have a TFE FDO mounted disk environment on GCP. 

The choice of operating system will also determine if you are using `docker` or `podman`

- `tfe_os = "ubuntu"`: installs and runs Terraform Enterprise using **Docker** 
- `tfe_os = "redhat"`: installs and runs Terraform Enterprise using **Podman**

## Install terraform  
See the following documentation [How to install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

## TLS certificate
You need to have valid TLS certificates that can be used with the DNS name you will be using to contact the TFE instance.  
  
The repo assumes you have no certificates and want to create them using Let's Encrypt and that your DNS domain is managed under GCP. 

# How to

- Clone the repository to your local machine
```sh
git clone https://github.com/munnep/tfe_fdo_gcp_mounted_disk.git
```
- Go to the directory  
```sh
cd tfe_fdo_gcp_mounted_disk
```
- Add your gcp authentication key as `key.json`
- create a file called `variables.auto.tfvars` with the following contents and your own values
```
# General
tag_prefix        = "tfe22"                       # TAG prefix for names to easily find your AWS resources
dns_hostname      = "tfe22"                       # DNS hostname for the TFE
dns_zonename      = "hashicorpdemo.com"           # DNS zone name to be used
tfe_release       = "1.1.3"                   # Version number for the release to install. This must have a value
tfe_password      = "Password#1"                  # TFE password for the dashboard and encryption of the data
public_key        = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaN"          # The public key for you to connect to the server over SSH
certificate_email = "patrick.munne@hashicorp.com" # Your email address used by TLS certificate 
tfe_license       = "02MV4UU43BK5HGYYTOJZ"        # license file being used
# gcp
gcp_region        = "eu-north-1"                  # GCP region creating the resources
vnet_cidr         = "10.214.0.0/16"               # Network to be used
gcp_project       = "hc-ff9323d13b0e4e0daee434a8171"
tfe_os            = "ubuntu"  # ubuntu  or redhat
```
- Terraform initialize
```
terraform init
```
- Terraform plan
```
terraform plan
```
- Terraform apply
```
terraform apply
```
- Terraform output should create 16 resources and show you the public dns string you can use to connect to the TFE instance
```
Apply complete! Resources: 16 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ssh_tfe_server = "ssh redhat@tfe33.hc-0ecd51335ae74f1089a9a431017.gcp.sbx.hashicorpdemo.com"
tfe_appplication = "https://tfe33.hc-0ecd51335ae74f1089a9a431017.gcp.sbx.hashicorpdemo.com"
tfe_instance_public_ip = "34.6.236.163"
```
- You can now login to the application with the username `admin` and password specified in your variables.

## Startup logs

With Ubuntu operating system the logs during installation are found in `/var/log/cloud-init-output.txt`. With RedHat and GCP you will need to use `journalctl -u google-startup-scripts.service --no-page -f`
